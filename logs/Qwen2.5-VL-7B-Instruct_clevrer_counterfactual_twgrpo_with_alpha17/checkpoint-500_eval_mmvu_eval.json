Given this context, let's consider each drug option:\n\n- **Insulin**: This is a hormone naturally produced by the pancreas and is crucial for regulating blood sugar levels. In cases where the body cannot produce enough insulin, insulin therapy is essential.\n- **Simvastatin**: This is a cholesterol-lowering medication used to reduce the risk of heart disease, not directly related to diabetes.\n- **Atenolol**: This is a beta-blocker used to treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions, unrelated to diabetes.\n- **Penicillin**: This is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, not diabetes.\n- **Metformin**: This is a common medication used to treat Type 2 Diabetes by helping the body use insulin more effectively.\n\nGiven these considerations, the drug most directly related to treating Type 2 Diabetes, as suggested by the video content, would be insulin or metformin.

The natural frequency of a beam is inversely proportional to its length and directly proportional to the square root of its density and the cube of its thickness. On the other hand, the maximum bending stress at the fixed end increases with the overhanging length and decreases with the thickness of the beam.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Decreasing the overhanging length and increasing the thickness of the ruler would decrease the natural frequency because the length is reduced, but it would also decrease the maximum bending stress due to the increased thickness.\n\nB. Increasing the overhanging length would increase the natural frequency and the maximum bending stress, which doesn't align with the goal.\n\nC. Increasing the overhanging length would increase the natural frequency and the maximum bending stress, which again does not meet the criteria.\n\nD. Increasing the overhanging length would increase the natural frequency and the maximum bending stress, which does not satisfy the condition either.\n\nE. Decreasing the overhanging length would decrease the natural frequency, and increasing the density of the ruler's material would increase the maximum bending stress at the fixed end.

However, the speedometer's mechanism, which includes gears and a pointer, would not inherently know that the wheel has become larger. Therefore, it would continue to register the same number of rotations per unit time as before, assuming the speedometer's calibration is based on the original wheel size. This means the speedometer would show the same speed as before, but since the wheel now covers more ground with each rotation, the actual speed of the vehicle would be higher than what the speedometer indicates.", "accuracy_score": 1.0, "format_score": 1.0, "think_confidence": 0.6171875, "answer_confidence": 0.98828125}
